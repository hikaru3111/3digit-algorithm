# 3digit-algorithm

This is a practice code.
This code works in CLI.
if you type 2 integer(such as "123456 3219"), then programm create permutations for each integer.
If the created permutations from two integer have same 3 character seauences(like "123"), the code stores the combination.
Finally, it returns the list of combination which has the same 3 character sequences.
